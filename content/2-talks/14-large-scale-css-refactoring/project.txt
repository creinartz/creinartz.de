My talk at CodemotionWorld Amsterdam 2016

The talk abstract:

*Project Ironman: the technical migration of the trivago hotel searchâ€™s existing CSS core. *

*Keeping technical debt low while developing a CSS base on a large scale project is a tough challenge. Even more exciting is to refactor existing CSS / frontend foundations which became cluttered. The talk will provide backgrounds, insights, learnings and technical approaches of refactoring a CSS base on a large scale project including its scope, the outcome and the business value.*
