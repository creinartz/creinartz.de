I had the pleasure to visit CODE University Berlin to talk about Web & product development. 

During the 90min session I presented a slightly adapted version of my "My Product has a Web Front-End" and I presented on top of that my Design System Engineering talk which I had given successfully at Code Europe in May 2017.
