After i had done two very successful variations of my talk about responsive web design i decided to apply as a speaker for the code.talks 2014 conference in Hamburg. This was my first talk on a conference event. I was honoured to do my talk on the main track in cinema hall 1 of the cinemaxx in Hamburg on a incredible huge stage. This talk was filmed, you find the video below.
