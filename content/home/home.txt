Text: 

Front-End Engineer,  Speaker and wannabe author from Germany. My current job is to lead the UI/UX Engineering team @(link: http://www.trivago.com text: trivago). I put all my passion and drive into the Front-End to keep it consistent, performant, scalable and maintainable. I'm not afraid to commit.

In 2016 I have already given several talks at conferences in Europe, such as ScotlandCSS, Frontend United, Symfony Live and more. Have a look at the (link: talks text: talks) section to find out more.

I've learned so much from the great developer community. I'm very grateful for that and like to give back as much as I can. In case you want to get me speaking at your event, do a Skype call with me or exchange about some topics with me feel free to get in (link: contact text: touch).
