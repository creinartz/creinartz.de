We started at the beginning of 2015 with building the first prototype of a pattern library. I stumbled upon HBR’s pattern-lab work flow that they used as part of their redesign. I liked the solution, having the whole development inside a vagrant environment to easily share the code amongst developers and have an easier installation process. Not everybody has a local PHP version or a development ready web server environment on their local machines and we use vagrant internally for most of our development environments. We forked the HBRGTech Repo and used this as a base setup for our development.
Our Case Study: Our goal was to redesign our company pages and to prove that a design-development process like Atomic Design is more efficient. The planned redesign was a case study for the project trivago and patternlab.
