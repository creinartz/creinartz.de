**Talk abstract**
I’ve worked for several years as a frontend developer in different agencies and since 2012 at trivago where I have been a Team Lead for UI/UX Engineering for years. I’ve shared a lot of experiences at different conferences in Europe from 2015 - 2017 and specialised in CSS and Design Systems. Recently though I left my comfort zone and switched roles to a product lead. In this talk I’ll explain what has inspired me over the years to leave my engineering role behind me, what I’ve learned during the transition and what challenges I have gone through.
