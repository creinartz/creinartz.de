Title: Public Speaking

I did my first talk at the (link: http://www.meetup.com/de-DE/PHP-Usergroup-Duesseldorf/ text: PHP Usergroup DÃ¼sseldorf) in April 2014. My good friend and highly admired colleague (link: http://andygrunwald.com/ text: Andy Grunwald) and organizer of this Usergroup empowered me to do my first talk there. I enjoyed it so much, that I did it again. Several times.

Topics I do like to talk about are quite diverse but mostly related to Design & UX, Frontend (mostly HTML and CSS) or other stuff I do care about like creating great things, culture and leadership.

You organize a Usergroup, Meetup or Conference? (link: contact text: Get in touch) if you are interested in me talking at your event.

Here's a list of past speaking engagements
